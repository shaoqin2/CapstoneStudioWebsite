# Capstone_Website
This is the Website developed for Capstone Studio. The overarching goal is to facilitate communication between parent, student and teachers. The current functionality include homework assignment to students, feedback to parents and a forum for students to post Q&A.  

The access to this website is restricted to students and staff in Capstone Studio. The gitHub repo is for code management and **show off** purposes(I know its shitty code, I know). If you want to take a look at the website, email me to get an account for demonstration purposes.
